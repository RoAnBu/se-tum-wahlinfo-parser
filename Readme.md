This small program imports the data from the xmls into Kotlin objects which can also be used by Java programs.

1. Install IntelliJ (a newer version with an installed Kotlin Plugin). 
2. Open the project with IntelliJ and make sure that you import the Maven packages
3. You need a java sdk, either installed system-wide or installed by intellij

4. Execute the main function in XMLWahldataParser.kt

5. Use the data. Ideally debug into line 42 and have a look at the data :)
